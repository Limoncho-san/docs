# How Does the Communication Work?

The RFID system can communicate in two main ways, depending on your setup. Your API can receive data either directly from the RFID reader or through a PLC. Here's how each option works:

## Option 1: RFID Reader → PLC → Your API

* **Step 1: RFID Reader Scans the Tag**
   * The reader detects an RFID tag and reads its data (e.g., the tag's unique ID).
* **Step 2: Reader Sends Data to the PLC**
   * The reader sends this data to the PLC using a connection like serial or Ethernet.
   * The PLC might use the data to trigger a physical action (e.g., opening a door) or simply pass it along.
* **Step 3: PLC Sends Data to Your API**
   * The PLC sends the tag's data to your API, typically via an HTTP request (e.g., a POST request with the tag ID).
* **Step 4: Your API Processes the Data**
   * Your API receives the data, processes it (e.g., checks if the tag is valid, logs it in a database), and sends a response back to the PLC (e.g., "access granted").
* **Step 5: PLC Takes Action (if needed)**
   * The PLC uses your API's response to perform an action, like unlocking a gate.

**In this setup**, the PLC acts as a middleman between the RFID reader and your API.

## Option 2: RFID Reader → Your API Directly

* **Step 1: RFID Reader Scans the Tag**
   * Same as above—the reader captures the tag's data.
* **Step 2: Reader Sends Data to Your API**
   * The reader connects directly to your API over a network (e.g., via HTTP or WebSocket) and sends the tag's data.
* **Step 3: Your API Processes the Data**
   * Your API receives the data, processes it (e.g., logs the scan, sends a notification), and might send a response back to the reader.

**In this setup**, there's no PLC involved—the reader talks directly to your API. This works if your RFID reader supports network communication.

## Where Does Your API Come In?

Your API is the **central hub** that processes the RFID data and decides what to do with it. Here's its role:

* **Receives Data**: It gets the tag data from either the PLC or the RFID reader directly.
* **Processes Data**: It handles tasks like:
   * Checking if the tag is authorized (e.g., for access control).
   * Logging the scan in a database (e.g., for inventory tracking).
   * Triggering actions (e.g., sending an alert or updating a system).
* **Sends Responses**: It might send instructions back to the PLC or reader, like "tag accepted" or "error."

Think of your API as the brain that takes raw RFID data and makes it meaningful.

## Simple Examples

Let's make it concrete with two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: With a PLC

1. An RFID reader scans a tag on a warehouse item.
2. The reader sends the tag's ID to the PLC.
3. The PLC sends an HTTP request to your API with the tag ID.
4. Your API checks the database, confirms the item, and responds with "item verified."
5. The PLC signals a conveyor belt to move the item.

### Scenario 2: Without a PLC

1. An RFID reader scans an employee's ID badge.
2. The reader sends the tag's ID directly to your API via an HTTP request.
3. Your API checks if the employee is authorized and logs the entry.
4. Your API sends a "door unlocked" signal back to the reader (if it supports it).

## Why Use a PLC?

You might wonder why involve a PLC if the reader can connect directly to your API. Here's the difference:

* **With a PLC**: Use it if you need to control physical devices (e.g., gates, motors) or if your system is part of a larger industrial setup. PLCs are reliable and built for tough environments.
* **Without a PLC**: Skip it if your reader can send data over a network and you don't need hardware control. This is simpler and more direct.
